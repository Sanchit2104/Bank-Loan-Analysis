# 🔍 Project Overview:
As part of a real-world data visualization initiative, I built a comprehensive Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard using Tableau to provide deep insights into a bank’s lending portfolio. This interactive report empowers decision-makers to assess loan performance, manage risk, and optimize strategy with precision.

# 📌 Key Objectives:

Monitor overall lending activity

Track cash flow and repayment trends

Identify high-risk loan patterns

Support strategic decision-making with real-time metrics

# 📈 What I Built:
# ✔ Dashboard 1: Summary

KPIs: Total Applications, Funded Amounts, Amount Received, Avg. Interest Rate, Avg. Debt-to-Income Ratio

Loan Quality Split: Good Loans (Fully Paid, Current) vs. Bad Loans (Charged Off)

Month-to-Date (MTD) & Month-over-Month (MoM) analysis

# ✔ Dashboard 2: Overview

Line Charts for monthly trends (Applications, Funding, Receipts)

Filled Map for regional performance across states

Donut Charts breaking down loan terms (36 vs 60 months)

Bar Charts showing impact of employment length & loan purpose

Tree Map analyzing loan activity by home ownership status

# ✔ Dashboard 3: Details View

Centralized table-style dashboard offering a holistic snapshot of each loan’s key metrics

Easily filterable for in-depth investigation of borrower profiles, repayment behavior, and loan health

# 🔧 Tools & Techniques Used:

Tableau for dashboard creation and interactivity

KPI benchmarking and advanced filtering

Data preparation & cleansing to ensure consistency and usability

# 📊 Impact:
This project simulates a real-world bank reporting system, enhancing the ability to drive informed lending decisions, assess borrower credibility, and track operational efficiency over time.
